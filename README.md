# Frontend Basics

This repository contains my practice code while learning **frontend development** step by step.  
I’m starting with HTML tutorials (W3Schools) and will expand into CSS and JavaScript.

## 📂 Structure
- **html-tutorial/** → HTML basics, forms, tables, lists, etc.(completed ✅)
- **css-tutorial/** → CSS selectors, box model, layouts, etc. (ongoing)
- **js-tutorial/** → JavaScript basics and DOM practice (later)

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong foundation in frontend before moving to **React** and advanced projects.

## 📝 Notes
Each topic folder may include:
- Example `.html` / `.css` files
- A `notes.md` file with short revision notes
